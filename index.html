          <p class="main-text">I was born in Norman, Oklahoma and attended college at the University of Oklahoma, where I majored in Political Science with a concentration in Campaign Management. After college, I spent my first year on various political campaigns around the Country, which ultimately led to working on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. I went into public policy consulting for a Fortune 10 company where I helped to write speeches and other collateral. My most recent position was with a Director at an Environmental non-profit. </p>
